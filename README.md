# Random_Area_Generator_Unity
A random map generator for Unity Engine. This is not totally my own idea. I watched a video tutorial by BlackthronProd and downloaded his code to learn how he did. https://github.com/BlackthornProd/Random-Dungeon-Generation.git  I did not want to rely on Unity collider but honestly, using collider makes things easier.
